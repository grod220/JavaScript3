## XMLHttpRequests
- What is an Http request?
    - Life of a request
        - https://dev.to/dangolant/things-i-brushed-up-on-this-week-the-http-request-lifecycle-
    - REST
    - Verbs
    - Headers
    - Status codes
- Example w/ curl
- Now how do we send a request with a browser?
- Websites of the early era required a complete page load upon each request (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming))
    - This is inefficient and provides a bad user experience with full reloads on each action. Example: MapQuest in the early days.
- AJAX
    - Gmail in 2004 and Google Maps in 2005
    - A way for browsers to send requests asyncronously! ðŸŽ‰
    - In 2006, W3C releated XMLHttpRequest specification
- XMLHttpRequest
    - Guide: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest

## API calls
- Open API's without need for auth tokens (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis/blob/master/README.md). Use one for example.
- Create new HTML file
- Create a button that will have an event listener
- Retrieve data from api with XMLHttpRequest obj

- ...but callbacks? [joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/che938/asynchronous_javascript/)
